# LinkUp
Linkup is an innovative social media app designed to facilitate real-life connections among users based on shared interests and activities. Unlike traditional platforms that primarily focus on online interactions, Linkup encourages users to create and join "linkups"â€”spontaneous meetups centered around hobbies, events, or activities.
