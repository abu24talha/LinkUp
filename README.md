# LinkUp
Linkup is an innovative social media application designed to facilitate real-life connections among users based on shared interests and activities. Unlike traditional platforms that primarily focus on online interactions, Linkup encourages users to create and join "linkups"â€”spontaneous meetups centered around hobbies, events, or activities.

Create Linkups: Organize and host linkups for various activities, specifying details like location, time, and type of event.

Discover Events: Browse and join linkups created by others based on interests and proximity.

In-Person Focus: The app emphasizes real-life engagements, helping users break out of their digital bubbles and explore new experiences together.

User-Created Linkups: Individuals can organize their own linkups, making it easy to connect with like-minded people.

Messaging: Communicate with users directly through in-app messaging to coordinate meetups.

Safety Features: Report inappropriate behavior and access moderation tools to ensure a safe environment for all users.
